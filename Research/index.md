## The long-term goals of our research are: 


### 1) to develop germplasm with improved tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses  


### 2) to generate genetic and genomic resources for taking forward wheat research




### The Li lab at SDState is focused on understanding genetics, genomics and evolution of wheat and its relatives and utilize the knowledge for germplasm enhancement:




### _CRISPR-based genome editing of grain size regulators for novel variation to increase wheat genetic yield potential_ [more](/grainsize_project/)





### _Dissecting the sea wheatgrass genome to transfer biotic stress resistance and abiotic stress tolerance into wheat_ [more](/swg/)





### _Root Development and VSR_





### _Understanding cuticular wax biosynthesis in wheat and its role in drought tolerance_





### _speciation of diploid and polyploid wheat and relative species and role of chromosome rearrangements_
